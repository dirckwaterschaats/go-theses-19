						Answers on how to combine two different mindsets on the mind and body into a unity. One says the mind and body are two separate parts that both life in different
						realms. The other mindset thinks the opposite, namely the mind and body consist
						in a continuum. They are one.<br><br>
						During my travels as a Pencak silat athlete I was able to experience both

						views on the mind and body. As a westerner I could train in Indonesia and experi-
						ence the contrast between training in the Netherlands at first hand. You could say

						that the main reason for this research was that I wanted to know why the contrast
						between the training/people in the East/West was so enormous. Within pencak
						silat or any other martial art it is about finding a balance between your mind and
						body. I wondered if you could benefit from the silat lessons about this balance in
						your work as a designer.<br><br>
						With the use of interviewing my silat teachers, here in the Netherlands but
						also in Indonesia, and discussing the experiences/thoughts of a graphic designer
						who grew up in both, this journey took many turns. My preliminary position on

						this matter was me thinking one mindset was ‘better’ than the other. But through-
						out the whole process I discovered flaws in both and we indeed need to find a way

						to combine them so we can create a well balanced life.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-samantha-van-roosenbeek/" target="_blank">Click Here for more </a></p>

						intimacy in a neo-liberal<br><br>

						This thesis tries to investigate love and intimacy in today’s career-driven culture, through a feminist critique. As a feminist, I see that the movement’s tendency is still to try and fit in a male discourse and body in terms of assuming an active roll in society. It is time to make our own roles and models. I think it’s important to bring to the table issues such as love and sexuality in an age where rationality and objectivity is valued over emotions and experiences. As our “work lives” are no longer separate from our “lives”, it’s important to reflect on how does this affect the way we love and are intimate with one another.
						<br><br> And in a age where feminism is no longer an F word and women are rising to powerful positions, it is also turning into a neo-liberal, capitalist movement that, as earlier stated, still values male dominated ways of being, thus complying with the patriarchal system it states to be against, not actively creating a change in socio-economical landscapes.
						<br><br> 
						This research was conducted through a speculative short story, in order to create a world where the merge of work and love has gone so far and they can no longer be perceived as two things. Speculation creates an imaginary setting that is based on present realities.

						impatient with what the body nature has given us with our frailties and
						limitations. While our mind soars, our bodies seem to frozen in time,

						but what if we can build a better body using technology to fix the human form and then improve upon it? Make it stronger, faster, smarter and

						create the human of the future. But what for? Transhumanists, or those
						who are loyal to the ideals of the improvement of the human species

						through enhancement as a moral obligation, believe they are the suppliers of the torch that will take us to an enlightened future. Transhumanism wants to dominate and modify the human nature, and take control

						of its human evolution to turn it into a post-human society, making the
						course of nature’s future a malleable property. In the present moment
						humankind has the power to modify its environment and it’s own nature,

						thins that before were just mere wishes or pure imagination. Transhumanist believe in the expression of a better (enhanced) humankind. This

						new possibilities of intervention have brought to the light the long
						debate of the relationship of the between humanity and nature and raise
						new questions about the consequences of this possible interventions.

						Throughout this work, I will question the implementation of transhumanist arguments and their philosophical ethics, counterposing them with

						the the questions of what is the notion of nature. The eager of human-
						kind to have control of nature. Their ideology is based on new techno-
						logical developments have to be discussed and analysed in depth, taking

						into account both the benefits and possible harms of its implications,

						as well as the consequences on the shift of the definition of human nature.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-sophia-de-jong/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

						million years ago. Despite the fact, that human
						life has not been present yet, it is important

						paying attention to it’s map as a possible nar-
						rative tackling our present concerns. Pangaea

						is a supercontinent, which means that all
						continental plates are mingling and shifting into
						one big disk. According to scientists, this event
						will happen again in about 250 million years in
						future.<br><br>

						History begins 70.000 years ago, with the
						cognitive revolution during which – we don’t
						really know why – we gained remarkable
						cognitive abilities. Above all to communicate,
						to use language, to create and spread fictions.

						Having a look at Pangaea, we have to acknowl-
						edge the fact that continental plates in one way

						or the other will become one. As a fictional
						narrative and as a model of thought, this would
						have major impact on how we think we could
						live and work all together.<br>
						The thesis aims at encouraging a narrative of
						our world that could help us staying with the
						trouble, growing and becoming greater than we
						are. By connecting current developments with
						the past and the possible future, Pangaea, as an
						utopian future, shall be the common ground
						encouraging us to question the basic human
						relations of our world. Change is the only
						constant.
						<br><br>
						The thesis is looking at some basic ideas of
						humankind – migration, collaboration and
						change – mostly in the context of Europe. The
						thesis does not provide a specific programme,
						but rather gives a point of view that could help
						imagining how our closest environments could
						work.<br><br>
						Regarding the current developments in global
						as well as european polity, it must seem like
						Pangaea has never existed. The disregard of
						Pangaea as a scientific fiction, providing a model
						of act and thought, must result in rigidity and
						stiffness, a flourishing ground for alternative
						skepticism and conservative flatness. As long
						as we do not embody this universal idea in our
						closest environments, society as we enjoy it will
						fall into pieces. Must Europe celebrate it’s death?<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-jan-husstedt/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

The one where you can stare into a sky so full of stars that you can’t even see a single constellation anymore? If you haven’t yet, let me tell you that in order to find it, you’ll have to go as far as you possibly can from any city light. Actually, artificial lighting has become so present in our daily life, that darkness has almost become a luxury. But while the topic of light pollution and dark skies preservation is starting to be more talked of, unpolluted dark skies are seen as something “out there”, outside of human activities which are definied by artifical light. Why is it that urban darkness is seen as dangerous or creepy while natural darkness is seen as beautiful and mysterious? In this thesis I will observe the relation and duality between the urban space and the wild space, the artificial and the natural, all within the topic of light and dark and I will argue that the urban and the natural can and should co-exist not only when it comes to “the greener cities” but also when it comes to “darker cities”.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-manon-feval/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

Prophecies and clairvoyant folklores to nancial risk prediction models and earthquake forecasting, the slow grind of time have prove to be taxing on us diesel monkeys and we are compelled to wonder further into the future without the shackles of present needs. It is an elusive state of being where there is no burden of proof and scenarios are dreamt in perpetuity. The portrayal of such a scenario tend to appeal to mutually shared sets of fundamental human conditions. Trans-generational aspirations, desires and fear are & the ever-eeting language of our projected futures knowing and unknowingly etched, scribbled, painted, recorded. Are these documentations, propagandist tools, delusional tales or semblances of comfort? The collective dream is neither optimistic nor nihilistic. It just is.

						In my thesis, I am researching and comparing historical paerns in how we continually portray the future in terms of images and symbolisms. I am fascinated by the possibly repetitive use of visual language in varying formats trying to describe the same fundamental human-centric future.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-kin/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

							until I found myself dancing on in certain clubs that I started to

							CAN BE NO FINAL REVOLUTION
							<br><br>
							“NOCTURNUS” AND ITS EFFECT ON THE HUMAN
							DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE VISUAL CULTURE IN THE

							AGE OF RADICAL ELATION.
							<br><br>

							Today we are living in the world where fear and doubt are being condemned to the ever-lasting flight down the void. This becomes a reason for us to start denouncing other crucial parts of our lives as

							non-important ones or as those that are reinforcing fears and insecurities in favour of artificial shelter made of all that successful compensating and striving of today. I see such escapism as an eminently
							important issue that can have poor fallout for our civilisation’s present

							and thus - future. This is why I am interested in the topic of noctur-
							nal culture and how dark aesthetics (especially the black image) and in

							general exposure to fear and dark concepts can influence our cognition

							and evolution. I strongly believe that such strategy can evoke high-
							er modes of both self and general analysis and bring out the natural

							curiosity in humans and ability of interpretation, that are now unfortu-
							nately put into lethargic sleep.<br><br>

							I seek to re-invigorate a sense of wonder, uncertainty and mystery in
							life by implementing and emphasising the dark colors, magic, questions
							with no answers and night. In order to do so, I want to look into history

							of how and if various parts of Nocturnal Culture were influencing hu-
							man evolution. And if they had an effect on individuals or masses (both

							positive and negative) in order to find proving arguments for my belief
							and be able to present it to our society which is drowning in “positive
							living bullet journals” and “books of everyday gratefulness” instead of

							simply turning of the lights and thinking. Along with that, topics of an-
							thropology of fear, darkness and the psychological influence of them

							onto our cognition will be discussed, concluding with the influence noc-
							turnal culture and esoterism had on the creation of contemporary art

							and visual culture.<br><br>

							As a strategy I’ve chosen to go from the opposites by destroying the
							arguments opposing my hypothesis through attempts of defending
							them. Presented partly through the voice of the main text and partly in
							form of dialogue extracts this paper is aiming to spark questioning of

							both sides and proving the absence of absolute. There can be no high-
							est number, as there is only totality and there can be no final revolu-
							tion as we exist. In such way this thesis is both: me finding artefacts of

							my beliefs and a manifesto to everything “Nocturnus”: of the night.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-darchiashvili-mariam/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

						De interesse in dit onderwerp ontstond uit de wisselwerking tussen mijn passie voor verven met spuitverf, waar het lichaam actief betrokken wordt, en digitaal grafisch ontwerp, waar fysieke interactie beperkt blijft tot de armen en handen. Ik vroeg me af of het gebruik van het menselijk lichaam mijn digitaal grafisch ontwerp kon verrijken.<br><br>

Het lichaam	neemt een actieve rol in binnen mijn ontwerp en ik was zelf overtuigd van de voordelen.

I will present the benefits of assembling a computer yourself, the power of a brand and why iMac Pro is just not a rational decision anymore.

						<div class="abstract" id="ab15"><p class="font15">Artificial Intelligence specialists predict that in 2035 we will have created an A.I. with consciousness. Nobody knows what would happen when machines start to become conscious. It is a very human way of thinking to imagine that a being that is superior to us will destroy us. Because humans has been conquering and destroying weaker and less advanced beings for all of their history. This does not mean that this the case for non-human beings. I am writing an alternative story of a possible, non-destructive but highly intelligent and conscious being. Unlike the  consciousness of humans, machine consciousness may not be shaped by evolutionary and survival pressures. This might result in a consciousness that has different mental states and a different way of looking at the world.
						<br><br>
						As the technology advances in neurology and artificial intelligence, human values may become more and more endangered. However, when we give rise to a new form of subjectivity that can experience the world unfiltered by self and other, we may be able to build a more hospitable future.<a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-jonathan-cho/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

Since there is a broad	perspective of aspects involving mythology and the way people deal with this, I choose to focus on one specific facet. This is how mythology/folklore/legends/fairy tales have influenced the lives of women, and if we can find aspects in these stories that may have helped women to find their voice in a society which for many years has seen them as lesser than men. In many cultures it is the wise old women that pass on the stories belonging to their culture. The stories, full of symbolism are there to inform you, to sooth you and to make you think about your place in the world. Because of this women were able to make their mark on history. So few stories are told from a woman’s perspective and/or place women as the protagonist. One of the fields where this did happen, is mythology. Folkloric myths and fairy tales have historically provided means of escape for women trapped in social roles, whether in the Greek tales of Artemis and Selene or the tales of the Brothers Grimm. Often these mythological stories are pushed away as fictive and as not as important as exact sciences, while actually a great deal of our society is based upon these myths. Which are the stories that could have helped us see the strength of women and pushed our ancestors to fight our equal rights? Can we still find strength in these stories? What specific symbolism is linked to women and their powers? How does our society now cope with these stories, how can we relate them to our everyday lives? What is the importance of looking back in these often fictive stories? How did mythology/legends/folklore/fairy tails influence history and inspire feminism?<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-pien-kars/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

						contexts, creating a new meaning within a new whole. I want to explore this subject because itʼs a technique thatʼs intuitively within my way of thinking and working. During my internship at the Verbeke Foundation I discovered how the word collage can for some mean a way of life instead of (just) a form of art. Later in my research I discovered how thereʼs a cliché image and idea we have which arises when hearing the word collage. Therefore I became interest in the idea of a more non-obvious, less logical and almost invisble form of collage
						<br><br>
						I want to shine a light on the meaning of collage in a broader, for me more essential sense. by breaking down the steps of the proceidure and the essential characteristics. I will dive into the possibilities of the non-obvious surprising forms of collage. I will explore the answers on those questions by going into dialogue with different people related to the subject of collage. Analysing characteristiscs of different collages in history and
						present will help me understand the connections between the process of creation and the impact of the visual outcome. (characteristics such as: visual features, how, why and when is it created). My answers will be expressed both textually as visually.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-rhode-tavenier/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab22"><p class="font22">Copper, the first metal processed by Neolithic humans has accompanied the history of humankind for approximately 10,000 years, disguised in various forms of tools, ornaments, sculptures, currency, weapons, and conductors of electricity. In the idea of New Materialism, the atomic number 29 as signed material has been an animate object for a transversal human agency that has conveyed the propagation of colonial ideologies between two formal imperialists, the Netherlands and Japan.
					<br><br>
					Former imperialists on the opposite coast of the Pacific enriched their territories which led the rise of colonialism, exchanging commodities and progressive ideas through the trade of copper. The mined raw copper was smelted in dif ferent forms that embodied the physical and spiritual desire of the imperialists, exploiting their colonies. The colonial era declined, but the post-colonial specters made of copper has been bequeathed as historical heritages and imperial hege monies, leaving wounds in the contemporary age.
					<br><br>
					Along with the transformation of copper on the colonial trajectory, Rusty Odyssey takes multidisciplinary roles of a historian and a graphic designer, provoking historian-disci plined statements interpreted in the artistic voice of a graphic designer to the ignorance of colonialism inherited over centuries and regions. It is a research essay of an interpre tation of historical documentation that applied an analogy of visual evidence in artifacts in historiographic and theoretical perspectives. This article also examines conflicts in the con temporary era over copper to lay the foundation of my future work through the perspective a Korean graphic designer residing in the Netherlands.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-Yeon-Sung/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab23"><p class="font23">In my thesis, I’m looking for possible tools for the Sami to render themselves visible. Sami people have formerly faced systemic oppression. They have been made invisible. Their bodies have been racialised, examined, scaled and measured. Fennoscandian countries Norway, Sweden and Finland tried to suppress the Sami voice. The nation states tried to silence the Sami language, and silence their drum.
					<br><br>
					Sami are the indigenous people of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Some Sami also live in Northern Russia. They are the only indigenous people recognised by the European Union, but no-one ever asked if they would like to join. Instead, their land was occupied and their history over-written. The above-mentioned Nordic nation states interfered with Sami territory, where they had been living in for thousands of years. Maps were drawn and documents created. According to the documents designed by the oppressors, the seminomadic Sami weren’t able to move across their land according to their natural, annual cycle. They had to choose between their colonisers.
					<br><br>
					In my thesis I’m asking how an oppressed language can emancipate and be noticed amidst the majority. I’m writing against a universe, I’m arguing for diverse conditions of living – a pluriverse. Furthermore I’m asking, whether, in the context of language, a typeface can become a vessel for communicating values of inclusion. Theory will be accompanied with very hands-on practical knowledge that I have gained along the thesis process through discussions, lectures and literature. Theory and practice intertwine and morph into a cyclical design methodology. This methodology will, in one way or the other, be used to actualise the graduation work that will follow. The endeavour is thus both theoretical and practical, preparing me to the actualisation of a culturally sensitive, multilingual design.
					<br>
					Monotheist religion and nation state have a long tradition in going hand in hand. Within our populist times, there is also a freak show of white suprematist ideas. During these times it is important to listen to cultures that operate with a whole another set of values.<br> My plan is to conduct a hands-on study of Northern Sami, Inari Sami and Skolt Sami, which are the three Sami languages spoken in Finland. For centuries, it was forbidden to teach or speak Sami languages in Fennoscandian schools. Because of polytheist and animist beliefs, Sami people were blamed for occultism. Sami children were taken from their parents age 7, and sent to boarding schools with strict discipline and punishments if speaking a word in their own language. The children were told that their culture is dying. Before the second world war eugenics was being introduced, especially in Sweden. Sami people were among those, who were being racially examined. Soon the Swedish State Institute for Racial Biology concentrated their racialising gaze wholly towards the Sami. Indigenous graves were being dug open to conduct more research.
					<br><br>
					Today Sami languages are reviving. They are being taught in schools and universities. In their written forms, the languages are based on the Latin script. However, there’s a scarcity of typefaces taking the typographic needs of Sami into consideration.
					<br>
					When including specific languages that are in a threatened position, can a typeface have a role in a cultural paradigm shift? Can it have a role in introducing a more inclusive tone of voice and facilitating change?
					<br>
					There are examples of insensitive type design trying to reflect the character of a culture, ending up as caricatures. Connections with linguistics and experts should be established. With care and thoroughness one can reach a conscious design that doesn’t appropriate nor stereotype.
					<br> As background, I will introduce some key elements of Sami world view and mysticism. These are essential tools that do not work by the logic of colonialism. This is a Northern real-life example of how language, and thus typography, is political. I believe to reveal something about the nature of typography as a tool for oppression and on the other hand, a means to include.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-risto-kujanpaa/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					In een wereld vol protesten en demonstraties, ben ik op zoek naar de eigenzinnige eenling met een diepgewortelde moraal. De eenling die iconische gebaren of symbolen gebruikt in de strijd tegen machtsstructuren. Ik voel vaak een diepgevoelde innerlijke moraal tegen onrecht, maar ik zet mijn woorden niet om in actie.
					<br><br>
					Wat is elk symbool of gebaar dat de beginnende activisten kan gebruiken? En hoe gebruiken de eenlingen deze symbolen of gebaren in hun acties tegen de verschillende machtsstructuren? Dit ga ik doen door 18 verschillende personen uit te lichten. In 9 verschillende hoofdstukken vergelijk ik twee of drie personen met dezelfde beeldtaal voor het voeren van hun strijd. Onafhankelijk van elkaar hebben ze hetzelfde symbool of gebaar gebruikt om actie mee te voeren.
					<br><br>
					Het eerste wat je moet doen is wat meer oproer maken, kies een regel en breek hem. Je moet wel bereid zijn deze regel te vervangen voor een beter alternatief. Iedereen kan actievoeren, alleen moet je de eerste stap durven nemen. Als je die eerste stap hebt gezet moet je alleen nog het juiste hulpmiddel vinden en je bent klaar voor actie. Als je mind-set maar staat op het maken van een verschil. De macht van de tegenkracht. De eigenzinnige eenlingen waren geen superhelden of speciale personen.

Often a place of contemplation, the known sky has never been a transparent landscape but a progressively stacking carrier of information and noise. Therefore, alluding to an ‘electronic sky’ that takes the name of The Ether; a hybrid place holding inter-dimensional qualities is evidenced. This is a site of growing heritage, broadcasting thecomprehensive data sets of the ancient world and the presentworld while presenting the co-ordinates of the next world.

					<div class="abstract" id="ab27"><p class="font27">Over the years at the academy I have been questioning the nature of my practice. I use words like intuitive, rhythm, recognition and sincerity to describe and justify my processes. Visually, my work tends towards the abstract side. The minimal usage of words to pinpoint what it is that I am actually creating, makes the work even less transparent and enables me to linger in this comfortable unknowing haze. Now, at the end of the four year programme I realize I’ve turned the whole experience into one ongoing personal project with no beginning and no ending. Despite the personal character, I have no clear understanding of my methods and my body of work. The Memory Theatre has created a space for me to overwrite my experiences in order to get more clarity.
					<br> <br>
					The original Memory Theatre constructed by Giulio Camillo is shaped like a Vitruvian amphitheatre. The area usually taken up by the audience is reserved for memories. The viewer takes center stage, facing the auditorium. In this setting memories taken out of their original context (the original experience), have the potential to interact with each other. Spaces, previously invisible, therefore become visible. And additional knowledge can be obtained due to a different time and space.
					<br><br>
					Despite its original construct, a Memory Theatre is in essence a mnemonic tool with the the ability to appear in any shape or form. Everyone is in fact their own Memory Theatre. My Memory Theatre, visualized, appears as an ocean, or a pool containing the entire constellation of my memories. I imagine the transition between sea and sky to be non-existent. In the Memory Theatre there are no rules. I consider it a space of potential where The Drifter, a persona, I identity with, is in its natural habitat. The sum of all my memories placed within this space should allow me to discover something I hadn’t been aware of before.
					<br><br>
					My thesis, another space of potential, is a verbal enactment of my Memory Theatre. By overwriting my experiences of the last four years, I’ve attempted to get a better understanding of my practice. The freedom, the Memory Theatre provides, allows me to place my work next to everything I consider relevant. Including my experiences outside of and prior to the academy. Contrary to the no rules character of the Memory Theatre, a thesis is still a written work and the act of overwriting is anything but undiscriminating. The merging of these two elements has given me new insights into my own practice.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-Kerrin-go/" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab28"><p class="font28">“A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.” In this thesis I am focussing on selfies. It is something that I always have thought is really interesting and weird. One could argue about whether selfies are actually new or old. Think about self-portraits for instance. People have been producing them for centuries, with the medium and publication format changing. Self-portraits are far less sponta neous and casual than a selfie is. The new genre isn’t dominated by artists, but by amateurs.
					<br>
					The selfie is a great example of how once elite pursuits have become a global visual culture. At one time, self-portraits were the preserve of a highly skilled few, now anyone with a phone camera can make one.
					<br><br>
					I also reflect on the history of narcissism through stories that have been told for centuries. For instance, the Greek mythology Narcissus. He was known for his beauty. When he saw an image so beautiful in the water, he fell in love with it he was unable to leave the beauty of his own reflection. In Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs the evil Queen speaks the famous line: “Mirror, mirror, on the wall – who is the fairest one of all?”. In both these stories the reflection of the self plays an important role. Not only does the surface reflect the Self, it is also a possibility of coming to know the Self. Today’s mirror could be our front camera on our phone.<br>
					Superbia, pride/vanity, is one of the seven deadly sins. It is almost on every list the original and most serious of all sins. Pride is identifies as dangerously corrupt selfishness. I started to wonder about the deeper meaning of these deadly sins, old mythology and childhood fairy tale. Why did they warn us about the reflection of the self and narcissism and selfi(e)shness?<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-linsey-dolleman" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

All of them question different aspects of the Art School, and suggest their own set of solutions.

					What’s different here? What do you learn?

					These places are developed in conversation with others affected. They enable us to gain new insights free from the bounds of application. Free from time and space. Whichever way suits us best.

Communication and therefore communities, are an essential part of human nature and history. The individual has always been a part of a bigger whole. This is because of our natural urge to share. We are social beings. When we share meaning, we share our existence and affirm each-other’s presence. We negotiate trust, truth and value. But the practices of sharing imply their very own rules. Sometimes they might even become games of power.
					<br><br>
					In my argumentation I compare communication to a game because of their similar features. Some being the participatory nature of the game and the rules that make the game what it is. When we communicate we participate in an exchange of meaning. It is like a game of sharing feelings, thoughts, experiences, information, value. Their expression is meanwhile governed by sets of rules. For instance the rules of languages, cultures, cultural institutions, media, etcetera.
					<br><br>
					The social world is a game in which we all participate. Today communication has become so ubiquitous and mediated that it seems like we do not share meaning anymore. We do not recognise each other and we become alienated from the other. This is because our common experience - the social world, is captured in a manipulated state of interactions. Free communication on the opposite creates shared meaning. But in order to escape the rules of these manipulated communication environments, we should be exploring new territories and creating spaces for free exchange. That would mean cheating in the social world or even creating new rules, that emerged in a dialogue between the participants of the social game, rather than imposed by outside forces. Imagination and play are crucial for the creation of these spaces. They help us to distance ourself from the situation and understand how things can be different.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-rossi-yotova" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

						<br>
						‘To have an irrational commitment to (something)’<br>

						This thesis aims to understand my practice as a graphic designer and more specifically my relationship it. By looking back at the 5 years I spend preparing myself to be a graphic I will explore the idea of becoming an achieving as a form of fetish. This thesis will explore the journey of one self through this process of becoming, and will place it in a bigger context, its desire to become, its failure of not being, the task of producing a final product and the value of it.
						<br><br>
						In order to tackle these large themes the thesis will begin with he falref my second year at KABK and how the idea that my work was not good enough became a personal failure and a personal belief of not being good enough. Graphic design became something too big to ever be mine and this was the start of obsession with it. My practice became a fetish because it became an unachievable object of desire, producing good work became essential to my validity as an individual it became the centre of my existence and a desire for the best version of myself had to be reflected in the projects I was able to produce.
						<br><br>
						This leads to my questioning of authorship, how healthy is it to see myself as my practice and can I ever separate myself from my practice? This question will be approach by investigating works by Barthes and Sara Ahmed on authorship and whether the author can ever be separate from the work it produces. The answer to the question will not be directly answered as there is no simple answer but rather I will continue to explore the relationship between myself and my practice by using different identity construction theories like Butler’s performativity and Munoz’s disindentification theory.
						<br><br>
						Through these theories I realize that I perform my identity as graphic designer and in order to dismantle the anxiety of producing a final ‘good enough’ product I need to understand that what I produce is not an essential representation of me but it is a fluid and temporal representation of something I created in a given moment and will continue to shift and grow with me, thus in a way my practice is non-existance, there is no graphic design that represents me because there is no me, there is only something I create in a certain moment within a time frame and according to my capabilities in that given moment. This liberates me from the pressure of producing and somehow gives me tools to understand my practice as something in a constant state of becoming, which I am able to re-appropriate.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-alfonso-yordi" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab33"><p class="font33">Did you ever had that feeling when texting someone, sending an email or some other type of message that you do not know how to put into words what you want to say. You are worried that the reader will interpret it in a different way than you intended, but there are just no other words to put it, to make it feel more right. Suddenly you wish you could be there, with him/her, so that he/she could see your face and listen to how you would say it, how your body would be aiding you in your words. Not only for the receiver to understand you better but also to instantly see the reaction, the emotions playing over the face, the way he/she holds his/her body.
					<br><br>
					These signals we provide help to mediate our intention when words alone do not suffice. We can always rely on our intonation, facial expression and bodily movements to change the tone of the words that we use. This non-verbal communication plays the most important part in our day-to-day contact.
					<br><br>
					Yet the written word does not support this language. It is characterised by its restrictions, its soundless, has a fixed form, and it is flat, two-dimensional. It is a system in which we cannot (yet) be bodily present. How could one see four dimensions at once? How do you catch those shifting and subtle changes of expression in the body? The question arises how words can accurately convey their meaning if the body is not present and if they in fact can at all. They are a beautiful attempt but scoring the moving, sounding body in 4 dimensions remains elusive.
					<br><br>
					This thesis argues, based on an analysis of the unique languages of both the body and the word, that a void arose in communication as the language of our body continued to get more and more lost in translation. The development of technology over the last hundred years only enforces this loss, this disembodiment. In contrast, it examines the manner in which the human body is captured and depicted through different (more artistic) writing methods, that try to break through all the aforementioned limitations of language, in search of a true writing of the body. Fiona Banners’s Perfomance Nudes and Christine sun Kim’s drawings among other things will help us to see the body as more of a communicative tool, one that escapes the grasp of words.
					<br><br>
					Through them we can discover how this void in communication not only has its negative qualities but how it in fact can be used as a (artistic) tool from which new methods can emerge. Methods where meaning can occur across linguistic understanding.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-wietske-nutma" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab34"><p class="font34">Cloth is discussed by anthropologists as being a means of cultural, social and personal expression, playing “a vital role in social reproduction through recurring acts of exchange that encourage both cultural continuity and transformation” (Perani and Wolff, 1999).
					<br><br>
					Everyday, everywhere, the fashion landscape of West Africa is taken over by vivid coloured and bold shaped patterned fabrics produced through wax-resist printing. The history of these clothes and their cultural value is diverse. The mechanised Wax Print cloth apparently signifies Africa however ironically it did not originate in Africa.
					<br><br>
					Basically, The African Wax Print Fabric started from The Netherlands.To be precise, it originated in Indonesia.In the early 19th , Dutch had colonial interests in Africa and Indonesia. and Vlisco started making and exporting Wax Print fabrics from The Netherlands in the late 1840’s. They first began replicating ethnographic fabrics by making roller printed versions of traditional wax print batiks from Indonesia. After all, The ‘Dutch Wax Print’ is becoming one of identity in West Africa for around 200 years.<br><br>
					However In the last decade the market has been flooded with Chinese Wax Print which is also imitation from Dutch Wax Print. and The imitation Wax Print textiles threaten Vlisco who is main Dutch Wax Print Fabric manufacturer in the Netherlands . Regardless of their background, the origin, Indonesia or Europe and their enormous Chinese imitations, this textiles have become a signifier of West African authenticity. In these fabrics we see an extraordinary fusion of Asian, European and African culture.
					<br><br>
					A developing Europe exploited Africa to enable the textiles industry out of which the Wax Print trade grew. Now that trade is being used as a tool for exploitation by a developing China. Maybe this is the colonial legacy of the Wax Print in economic and trade terms, ironically one that threatens the positive legacy, which is the new generation of African factories, some of which are part of the responsible actions of post - colonial Holland.
					<br><br>
					This essay will deal with the ‘Ironic Imitation Cycle’ between Asia - Europe, tracing back to the origin of Wax Print Fabric. Additionally, how a continent could absorb so utterly something so foreign into its own tradition and what meaning are attached to the cloth its users?<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-bohwa-jang" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab30"><p class="font30">Nothing you will read in this thesis is new, but it is exactly what this is about. Individuality is the Blueprint of our culture. Who am I? a question posed by many and since we have passed a time where living is purely focused on surviving, defining your own identity became one of the most aggressive tasks of modern society. Through admitting this, I hope to start this thesis by being aware, that I myself try to differ, to stand out, to do my own thing, autonomously developing my identity as a professional. But whose words are these? The environment I grew up in formed my opinions, the structure I studied in my practice, everything that I create becomes real through several technologies and the language I use which is legally considered as public property. Does the work I produce belong to everybody equally as it belongs to me? Who is the author of my thoughts? Where do things come from and where can we take them to?
					<br><br>
					In the privileged moment of individualization in the history of knowledge, science and art, ideas are our commodity. Although we do acknowledge that thoughts come from a more complex constellation of things, we are easy in patronizing our own creative outcome. Every book has an author, every work an originator. The power belongs to the original! By pointing out another creatives un-originality, the critic has become a vocal sword fighting against the appropriation of the genuine. But who has the power to decide that one is less true than the other: All exists simultaneously. It is a frequent habit when I discover several resemblances between two things to attribute to both equally, even on points in which they are in reality different, that which I have recognized to be true of only one of them. Combined with this is another perversity, an innate preference for the represented subject over the real one. (Oliver Laric) The real one is the first time we see, yet taking twin siblings who look identical but are born seconds apart, one is not less true than the other. Both seem to be equally original. Originality itself implicates a singularity. What seems to matter the most for this thesis is that I disagree with the idea that an author is something a single individual can play. An author function became something anyone can play; The user gets to be a producer and vice versa; Creation becomes a collaborative act and the idea of one great man who owns a thought obsolete. Taking this position is already an antithesis to what art seems to be seen as: the creation of an autonomous genius. With the freedom to write whatever they may please. (Walter Benjamin) Per definition, autonomy is independence. But we are always dependent on someone or something else, the system, the environment, the sponsor or a client that might shape how we work or who we become. Trying to achieve full autonomy seems to be a readymade fairytale, which already makes one of my intentions for writing this thesis obsolete: I will not become an autonomous designer in the end. Influence is inevitable.
					<br><br>
					Since the author function has multiplied, so has the possibility to be influenced by each others ideas, cultures and opinions. Multiplication, mimicry and appropriation, have become the petrol of culture and although we want to see it as something that is harming the artists autonomy, we will not be able to avoid it anyhow. What we like, we share and the authority of an author in times of posts and reposts has become very void. Published is for the public! It is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; (Thomas Jefferson).
					<br><br>
					Today, almost anyone is an artist. (Hito Steyerl) In the 21st century knowledge is shaped by a bigger community than just the experts of their fields. Design became everyday life, something anybody can do and does. The tools to create have been made accessible to the masses and along this accessibility comes a demand for an active reader role to participate! Produce! Publish or Perish! But the intentionally positive evolution of Open Source (et al.) programs also includes a threat for the conventional creative. If anybody can do what the professional creative claimed to do, what is the role of the designer in the contemporary society today? How does crowd creativity interact with original material? How can we restrict the amateur authors from editing open accessible online platforms like Wikipedia in a dilettantish manner? And who owns creative outcome in times of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence? The program, the human, the entire human species? Does the rise of the creative lead to the fall of the creative by the age of 33 years like Ikarus who flew too close to the sun?
					<br><br> The following text is structured in little episodes, where I find ideas in different executions, sometimes similar but forever coexisting – a personal selection. Within the episodes I am going to explain theories of creativity and authorship, the hypothesis of Multiple Invention and briefly introduce Design Learning, Design Thinking and Why the Thrive for Originality can be Contagious – If not toxic. The chapters are structured that I requlessly stole from Michel Foucault.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-theresa-scherrer" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab35"><p class="font35">In my thesis I am focusing on the danger of collectivism and where it leads/led humanity. The topic comes from my own cultural background. I am from Slovakia which throughout the history used to be part of bigger social, political system. I was always fascinated by how influential communism was in my country. Slovakia also used to be part of “bigger picture” like the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary Empire and later we were part of Communist system, later we were created into one country with Czech Republic, called Czechoslovakia, and of course now we are part of European Union. I think from there I came to a question of the ideology of collectivism. I am connecting the issue of collectivism with biblical stories which warn us about its power. I consider bible as very powerful document where whether you look at this more philosophical, historical or from religious perspective. I focus on specific stories, where bible warn us about power of human unity. 
					<br><br>
					One of them is the story of Babel Tower from Old testament, the second is the Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream & Daniel’s translation of this dream from Genesis and the book of Revelation where apostle John describes the end of the world, the apocalypse, will happen once we will create one world government. Throughout these stories I am trying to find what makes collectivism dangerous and how it influenced political systems throughout the history of the world.How far can we go with the idea of one world, one government? One world government is a current topic of many discussions and people are wondering whether it will lead us to the“world peace” or if it will create a total dictatorship.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-dominika-fojtikova" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

						The subject of my research is the invisible sets of structure that are overlooked inside the environment of art education in the Netherlands. How these hidden sets of rules are actually the major factor that is determining the development process inside the journey of finding “originality” for students as myself within the graphic design education. Through this project, I am investigating invisible or hidden sets of standards among students at art schools in the Netherlands and in graphic design education in general. I want to take it to the surface and furthermore, I am comparing this research to my own experiences as a student at KABK. In my project I am looking for relevant empirical data (i.e. articles, papers, etc.) generate my own data in collaboration with relevant participants and make a narrative story based on my own experiences. My overall research question in this project is concerned with how hidden sets of standards/ curriculum among students might affect the individuals creative process and possible lead to similarities or trend that will affect the individuals own identity in terms of graphic design. My goal is trying to pull these invisibles to the surface, put it on the table so we can realize and analyse them to reflect on them, make use of them or maybe even modify them for the better.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-rully-irawan" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab37"><p class="font37">One of the first people who attempted to define fine arts was the French philosopher Charles Batteux back in the 18th century. As he was naming mediums appropriate for fine arts he omitted drawing from his list because he deemed it to be a merely preparatory form of art. Jump forward a couple of centuries to today and we are glad to see that his definition has not aged well. Fine arts definitely does not stand just for the aesthetically pleasing imitation of nature as he proposed, however, the bias against drawing (and as an extension most forms of art deriving from it such as illustration, comics or animation) is still strong. To this day they are mostly seen as something only children are allowed to show interest in and should be set aside and grown out of eventually into something “greater” or “more mature”. In my thesis I would like to take comics as my main research subject and investigate the footprint comics have had on art, culture and education dating back from cave paintings all up until today. Why is there a fear to be associated to this medium or even the word comic itself? Why do most people see it as something that can only manifest within the realm of mass art? Is it really just a form of entertainment?<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-greta-radzeviciute" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab39"><p class="font39">Corona Civica is an analysis of symbolic value through the case of the laurel wreath, the symbol of victory. The amplification explores the mythological origin, historical value, transition, meaning and contemporary application. While a modern conception of victory seems to be peaceful and societal, the mythological narrative and the historical perception provide a rather violent definition of victory. It is the glory of the individual through domination and conquest. The symbol underwent a transition both from individual to collective and from physical object to visual representation.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-kylien-bergh" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab40"><p class="font40">An ax, shovel and a fishhook. Trees, metals, and the ocean. All have been of incredible importance in the development of our tools, which make it possible for us to have the tools and products we have today. But more often than not we can observe the overuse of our tools, and the abuse of nature by our tools. When cutting down one tree, an entire forest is taken down with it. When digging for metals, the earth now has holes as deep as mountains for us to extract our gold, metals, and minerals.
					<br><br>
					This paper researches the fine balance between power and overpower over nature which we accomplished trough our tools. Whether that tool is an ax, a shovel or something as small as a fishhook. As a case study to further explore this relation between the human, nature, and our tools, I take sports fishing as example, in which the imbalance between power and overpower over nature can be observed. I want to change current perception of our tools into one that is more environmentally conscious by investigating the human relation and materialisation of nature trough the application and design of our tools, specified to the world of sports fishing.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-EvyvSchelt" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>

					<div class="abstract" id="ab41"><p class="font42">I am an introvert. It’s not necessarily the core of my personality but it definitely influences my everyday life, my friendships, network or working method. Does that mean that I create different artworks then extroverted artists? Or does that mean I read artworks differently than others? Not necessarily, but can I capture this specific type of personality through my design, can I translate that into a visual language?
					<br><br>
					In my thesis I research the theory of introversion via psychological studies and tests, creating a definition that is applicable to art. I analyse artworks to understand the way they represent introversion and the tools they are using to create the work’s “identity”. With my research, I aim to provide an inside on how psychology can affect and influence art and provide consciousness about building a specific atmosphere/identity in order to communicate the message in the most precise way to the right audience.<br><a href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-Artur-Andrasi" target="_blank"> Click Here for more </a></p>
